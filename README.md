### I’m a programmer on beta testing.

Hi there! My name is Eleazar and I’ve been doing programming since 10th grade!

I’ve always been a type of person that enjoyed solving things. When I was young, I enjoyed playing games that involves puzzles, problem solving, and logical thinking. *Professor Layton* and *Ace Attorney* are some of my favorite games to play.

I was fascinated by the nature of programming when I first heard of it. From that spark of curiosity, I started learning the art one step at a time. C is my first programming language that taught me the important fundamentals and core aspects of programming. Thanks to it, I become more comfortable in learning other programming languages and technologies.

During my spare time you might find me reading some manga, watching an anime series, playing some rhythm games such as *osu* (I’m not good though), or just simply taking a nap. 

As of now, I’m focusing myself more on web development. I recently graduated from senior high school (ICT Strand) and currently taking my bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. Wish me luck!

### Things that I should do

:pencil: Do more projects in order to build a portfolio.

:walking: Be more responsible

:telescope: Exploring and learning things

:full_moon: Having a good night sleep
